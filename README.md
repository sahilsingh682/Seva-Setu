## 📖 About The Project
 
In rural India, millions face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare information due to low literacy rates, language barriers, and the sheer complexity of medical jargon. Furthermore, many citizens remain unaware of government health schemes designed specifically for their demographics.

**SevaSetu** bridges this gap. Built as a highly optimized **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, it serves as an all-in-one digital health companion. It leverages cutting-edge AI to process complex medical documents, provides multilingual voice assistance, and actively matches users with life-saving public health benefits—all through an interface that feels like a native mobile app without requiring an app store download.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎙️ Multilingual AI Clinic
To combat literacy barriers, SevaSetu integrates real-time **Speech-to-Text (STT)** and **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**. Users can navigate the app, ask medical queries, and receive guidance using their voice in local languages (Hindi, Punjabi, English).

### 📄 Intelligent Health Vault
Medical reports are notoriously hard to read. Users can upload their lab results (PDF/JPG), and SevaSetu's AI-driven document analysis will parse the data. It returns a simplified, color-coded health summary, translating complex biomarkers into plain, actionable language.

### 💻 AI-Generated Health Report (Desktop/Export View)
SevaSetu automatically generates clean, printable medical summaries from uploaded lab reports.

### 🏛️ Smart Government Scheme Matcher
A multi-step filtering engine that assesses user demographics (age, income, location, medical history) to instantly match citizens with relevant, eligible government health programs, ensuring they get the financial and medical support they deserve.

### ⚡ Offline-Ready PWA Architecture
Designed for areas with unstable internet connections. SevaSetu caches vital resources locally, allowing users to load the application and view previously fetched data even when offline.
